# Embedding Graphs on a Grassmann Manifold

This repository is the official implementation of [Embedding Graphs on a Grassmann Manifold, Neural Networks (2022)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608022001733).

## Requirements

To install requirements:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```
python main.py
```
Other hyperparameters include: --dataset, --lr, --wd, --conv_hid --fc_dim, --s, --drop_ratio, --pRatio.

## Node Clustering
To reproduce the results in Table 3 of the main text, you can use the following command:

```
python train_vae.py
```
The default arguments are for reproducing the results of Pubmed.
